In this custom-made mini-game, you control two rocket ships with realistic gravity affecting them, attempting to stray their course from an imminent crash into a nearby planet. You use a traditional four-direction control pad to accelerate left, right, up, and down, and utilize one of the two extra red buttons to reset the game.
